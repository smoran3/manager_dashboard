# manager_dashboard

concept development of a dashboard to make it easier for managers to track the status of multiple ongoing projects

## To Do:

- use new WP API
- need a way to select project IDs to include (settings) and to select which momth to view (be able to change regularly but default to current/latest)
- need a way to save the projects each user selects
- add button to show all existing monthly reports for a given project?
- how to add projects from past FYs (probably in initial project selection)?
